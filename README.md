# INN Webshop demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The most recent version of the Create React App user guide can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

This is a simple SPA of a webshop to demo the use of InnSPAClient npm-package.

Developed using Bootstrap, React and Redux.

## Development

1. Step 1: Install dependencies - `npm install`
2. Step 2: Run development server - `npm start`
3. Step 3: Write code and profit!

The site can be run/build as to different webstores(site1: "Elektro247", site2: "Sko247").<br>
To specify which site to build, set environment variable `REACT_APP_SITE` equal to `site1` or `site2` before build.
For example:

```
set "REACT_APP_SITE=site1" && npm start
```
